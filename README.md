# Swara-Detection-using-TensorFlow
Description:
Our capstone project aimed at detecting swaras in Hindustani Classical Music. Each swara was meticulously labeled using Label Studio, serving as training data for our model. Leveraging object detection techniques, we developed a robust algorithm capable of accurately predicting swaras. This repository contains the codebase, dataset, and documentation detailing our methodology and results, contributing to the advancement of music analysis and cultural preservation.

Technologies Used:

Label Studio
Object detection algorithms
Python, TensorFlow

Impact:
This project holds significance in the realm of music analysis and cultural preservation, offering a novel approach to automatically detect swaras in Hindustani Classical Music recordings. By making the codebase and dataset publicly available on GitHub, we aim to foster collaboration, facilitate reproducibility, and encourage further research in this domain.
