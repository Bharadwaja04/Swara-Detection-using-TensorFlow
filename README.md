# Swara-Detection-using-TensorFlow
Description:
Our capstone project aimed at detecting swaras in Hindustani Classical Music. Each swara was meticulously labeled using Label Studio, serving as training data for our model. Leveraging object detection techniques, we developed a robust algorithm capable of accurately predicting swaras. This repository contains the codebase, dataset, and documentation detailing our methodology and results, contributing to the advancement of music analysis and cultural preservation./n/n

Key Features:

Swara detection model trained on labeled Hindustani Classical Music data
Implementation of object detection algorithms for predicting swaras
Detailed documentation outlining the project's methodology, results, and future enhancements
Technologies Used:

Label Studio
Object detection algorithms
Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV
Impact:
This project holds significance in the realm of music analysis and cultural preservation, offering a novel approach to automatically detect swaras in Hindustani Classical Music recordings. By making the codebase and dataset publicly available on GitHub, we aim to foster collaboration, facilitate reproducibility, and encourage further research in this domain.
